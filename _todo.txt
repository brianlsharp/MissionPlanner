- be able to read in a BadgerReport so that we can get ground truth data, read it in, and compare on screen.
- faster way to delete pins
- "suspect readings" button
- toggle rover icon
- generate reports in decimal feet, or at least with a column in decimal feet
- record the name of the logfile in exported report
- record the name of the logfile in the polygon file
- if you get a message with readings at the exact same location, don't put another pin there. go with what's higher or something. Had trouble selecting individual ones for export. Always show ones for export on top?
- create a README file that explains the basics. Like which color contacts will be exported. What the unknown hotkeys are (like using R to make the corners of the poly) and some pitfalls (like remember that you have to save the poly).
- have some other way to know if a marker is set for export. Edit tooltip text or menu item (but when the menu pops up, don't know which marker we're over top. That is determined after ).
- remove some tabs in the lower left pane
- right now, if you mark some items for export. That info is not being saved out in anyway. If we're out in the field testing and mark some for export, we can export them and that's all great... until we want to post process that data and just have the raw points. Need to have that export property saved out somehow.
- MOve the items in the "Add POI" menu item into the top level menu - no longer as a subitem of "Add POI".
- colored bar for bad gps connection
- colored bar for detection
- user determined pin color, or way user-added pins are different color.
- Import saved contacts from file.
- try a build in release mode. don't want to be running it in debugger on competition day
- edit label for existing pin
