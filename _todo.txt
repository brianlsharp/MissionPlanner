- keep measuring distances until the user exits that mode.
- accept ground truth inputs in feet
- when loading ground truth, be able to do multiple points at the same time without selecting new origin and ref
- work on cheat sheet doc
- what if we screw up making the polygon? Way to delete them? or individual points of it?
- some way to indicate scale
- shorten context menu by adding buttons
- perhaps the "Create Report" dialog should feature a series of checkboxes that allows the user to select which things they want to export. Options would be "marked for export", "suspect readings", "not suspect, not marked for export"(regular)
- "suspect readings" button and mode
- edit label for existing pin
- MOve the items in the "Add POI" menu item into the top level menu - no longer as a subitem of "Add POI".
- be able to read in a BadgerReport so that we can get ground truth data, read it in, and compare on screen.
- "suspect readings" button
- toggle rover icon
- generate reports in decimal feet, or at least with a column in decimal feet
- record the name of the logfile in the polygon file
- if you get a message with readings at the exact same location, don't put another pin there. go with what's higher or something. Had trouble selecting individual ones for export. Always show ones for export on top?
- create a README file that explains the basics. Like which color contacts will be exported. What the unknown hotkeys are (like using R to make the corners of the poly) and some pitfalls (like remember that you have to save the poly).
- have some other way to know if a marker is set for export. Edit tooltip text or menu item (but when the menu pops up, don't know which marker we're over top. That is determined after ).
- remove some tabs in the lower left pane
- right now, if you mark some items for export. That info is not being saved out in anyway. If we're out in the field testing and mark some for export, we can export them and that's all great... until we want to post process that data and just have the raw points. Need to have that export property saved out somehow.
- colored bar for bad gps connection
- colored bar for detection
- user determined pin color, or way user-added pins are different color.
- Import saved contacts from file.
- try a build in release mode. don't want to be running it in debugger on competition day


+ faster way to delete pins
+ right click exits current mode
+ button that enters "Multi-delete" button mode where you click to delete pin
+ once you click the "export" menu item, there's no way to cancel. CLicking on the "x" in the prompt windows should do that.
+ mark pins for export
+ Add Button to clear pins.
+ Add Button to show/hide pins.
+ record the name of the logfile in exported report
