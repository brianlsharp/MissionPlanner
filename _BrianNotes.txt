End of day: Ready to start programming the radios, hoping that their firmware is set to something that is able to do the multicast.

seems like we're having the issue with registering too many clicks whenever we try to select a marker that has multiple at that point. especially if you get the thing where multiple tool tips are up, then if that's the first marker you're trying to click, it'll think it's both of them.

Good resource for info on the map stuff:

Working on getting user-defined polygons in there. The functionality already exists in "Flight pLanner" screen. And you can even view it with live data, by right clicking on the map while in the "Flight Data" tab. It is much slower to respond though. Will be wanting to port that ability to draw polygons over to the Flight Data screen. Ideally, the user could push a button to mark a corner, or load a saved polygon from disk. Even better, we may want it to where the user presses a button, the current location is grabbed, and then the user can define a polygon based on distance offsets from it.

Well I changed it so that MissionPlanner's CurrentState.cs only updated its lat/lng when GPSStatus2 == 5. But I still got some big skips from the mission on 22 March. Not as many, but still some, and just as severe as the others. 

Been noticing that in Mission Planner, the rover is bounching between Piksi GPS and crappy GPS. Sometimes, even when the Piksi Console says that it still has Fixed RTK. Going over the log files, it looks like FlightData.cs will be receving and updating its lat/lon based on EITHER messages received from either GPS1 or GPS2. So if the Piksi is supposed to work right out of the box, then the ardupilot embedded software shouldn't be transmitting that GPS info unless GPS2Status is less than 5. Perhaps there is an issue on the embedded side.
